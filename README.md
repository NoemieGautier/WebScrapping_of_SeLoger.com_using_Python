# WebScrapping_of_SeLoger.com_using_Python
In this project, I extracted data from SeLoger.com regarding the housing offers for rent or purchase in four cities of the North of France: Faches-Thumesnil (59155), Ronchin (59790), Wattignies (59139), Lesquin (59810). The goal was to find the average housing price in these cities and compare our findings. The data was processed and analysed using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook. Some key variables used for conducting exploratory data analysis included  average housing price, price per square meters, number of rooms as well as some demographic information gathered on these cities (average salary, unemployement levels...). Data visualization and interpretation is presented in the analysis presentation.
